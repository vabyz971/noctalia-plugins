# 📱 Valent Connect Plugin for Noctalia

Integrate your mobile devices via the Valent backend. This plugin provides a seamless UI to interact with your phone, powered by Valent (an implementation of the KDE Connect protocol for GNOME/GTK environments).

## What's New (v1.2.0) ✨

- **🚀 Reliable Refresh**: Improved device discovery logic to ensure a single tap correctly updates the device list and status.
- **🎨 Improved Animation**: Stabilized the header layout and implemented a smoother, more reliable refresh animation.

## Requirements

### Packages:

- `valent` - the daemon (AUR: `valent`)
- `gvfs` - for SFTP mounting
- `gvfs-mtp` or `gvfs-backends` - GVfs backends including SFTP
- `openssh` - for SSH agent

### SFTP & SSH Agent Setup:

Valent uses GVfs for SFTP mounting. This requires an active SSH agent to manage keys.

**Enable SSH Agent:**
Recent GNOME installations move the SSH agent to a separate service. Enable it if not already running:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now gcr-ssh-agent.socket
```

**Environment Configuration:**
Add the following to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshenv` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gcr/ssh"
```

**Verify Setup:**
```bash
echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK  # Should show /run/user/1000/gcr/ssh
ssh-add -l           # Should connect to the agent without error
```

### Start the Daemon:

You can start Valent manually or via systemd:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now valent
# OR
valent --gapplication-service
```

#### Niri Example (`~/.config/niri/config.kdl`):
If you use the Niri compositor, ensure the environment variables are imported:
```kdl
environment {
    SSH_AUTH_SOCK "/run/user/1000/gcr/ssh"
}

spawn-at-startup "systemctl" "--user" "import-environment" "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
spawn-at-startup "valent" "--gapplication-service"
```

## Phone Setup

1. Install the **KDE Connect** app on your phone (Android/iOS).
2. Ensure your phone and desktop are on the same network.
3. Open the Valent Connect panel in Noctalia.
4. Select your device and click **Pair**.
5. Accept the pairing request on your phone.

## Features 🌟

- **🔋 Battery Tracking**: Real-time battery level and charging status.
- **📶 Connectivity Info**: Signal strength and network type (5G, LTE, etc.).
- **🔔 Find My Phone**: Ring your device remotely.
- **📡 Send Ping**: Test connection with a notification.
- **📁 File Sharing**: Send files from your PC to your phone.
- **📂 Browse Files**: Mount and browse your phone's filesystem via SFTP.
- **💬 Notifications**: View the number of active notifications on your device.
- **🔄 Manual Refresh**: Trigger device discovery and update device state with a single tap.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not appearing**: Ensure both devices are on the same network and the Valent daemon is running (`systemctl --user status valent`).
- **SFTP not working**: 
    - Verify `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is correctly set.
    - Check if the phone's SFTP plugin is enabled in the KDE Connect app.
    - Manually test mounting: `gio mount sftp://PHONE_IP:1739/`.
- **Logs**: Check Valent logs for errors: `journalctl --user -u valent -f`.

*Note: This plugin is designed specifically for the Valent backend and does not require or use the `kdeconnectd` daemon.*
